# K-Emotion Sentiment Analysis for CS 549 at San Diego State University

A project by Riley Mathews, Elias Mapendo, and Logan Wolff.

Sentiment analysis describes the act of computationally identifying a writerâ€™s attitude toward a specific topic.

Cases include:
    - Movie reviews
    - Customer feedback
    - Public reactions

Our group noticed how sentiment analysis is usually implying either a positive and negative tone, and wanted to train a model extending the scope to K Emotions.

## Dataset

Hugging Face is an open-source machine learning platform that, among other tools, provides access to datasets and models.

The Hugging Face dataset from user dalopeza98 titled isear-cleaned-dataset provided organized text and labels relating to the ISEAR project.

The ISEAR project was an effort from psychologists around the globe in the 1990s to survey student respondents on situations in which they had experienced 7 major emotions.


## Model

Google introduced a language model titled BERT in the October of 2018.
BERT stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers
Transformer Architecture High level overview:
    - Text is broken into tokens
    - Tokens are converted into embedded vectors
    - Embedded vectors are then utilized to predict next likely tokens

Our course of action was to fine-tune the BERT model with respect to the ISEAR dataset containing 7 classes. 

## Running the python notebook file

To run the notebook file, Google Colaboratory is recommended. The RAM required for training is past the capabilities of the average laptop or PC.
